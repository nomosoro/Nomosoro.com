                <p>Little blue is my first attempt to build a fully functioning 3D character for my later game development, and I chose Autodesk Maya 2017 as the software. You can have a quick peak of the final result of little blue at my youtube channel : <a href="https://youtu.be/Khw_lMcZnfg" target="_blank">Little Blue Buddy and his movesets!</a>. I will try to cover the making procedure of Little Blue together with some conclusion and insights.</p>
                
                <h3>Prototyping</h3>
                <p>The idea of Little blue stemmed fron a game idea, in which players are going to play as a lonely furry little guy with a torch only to explore the environment and survive. Although this game will probabbly kept in conceptual form, I decided to develope our furry guy out, and it finally has its form now. </p>

                    <span className="img-caption">The possible movesets for furry budy</span>
                </div>
                <p>Above are some sketched prototypes during the design of our furry guy, luckily I managed to feature the round torso and those slim arms. For the furry part, I am plannig to implement it in Unity Shader scripts, that is another story.</p>
                <h3>Modeling</h3>
                <p>The modeling of Little Blue, as you can easily figure out, is very simple. After several failures and re-works, I modeled the final version within 1 hours.
                </p>
                <div className="article-img-set-wrapper">
                    <div className="img-set">
                        <img src="./img/portofolio1_model1.png"></img>
                        <img src="./img/portofolio1_model2.png"></img>
                        <img src="./img/portofolio1_model3.png"></img>
                    </div>
                    <span className="img-caption">The final version of Little Blue Model, in frame 1 ideling stance.</span>
                </div>
                <p>To quickly recap, the final model has 1096 faces, consists of a main sphere torsor and slim cylindrical arms and legs. To simplify the tasks and also to accelerate the practice, I made his hands a club like capsule object, and it seems legid when Little Blue is interacting with other objects in the game. I exaggerated the ratio setup in the prototype for his arms and legs, for the more slimer he seems more lonely and helpless, cant even stand the first round of fight.  </p>
                <p>Because it is my first try, so I will not blame myself much for the mistakes in the final version. However some of those flaws made me suffer a lot in later production. The geometry around every joints of Little Blue are horribly arranged, and when I was doing rigging/skinning and animation the problems are enlarged, that the geometry around joints are ugly and distorted when joints are rotating. The glitches are nearly intolerable. </p>
                <h3>Texturing</h3>

                    <span className="img-caption">The UV map of Little Blue</span>
                </div>
                <p>Thanks to the symetric and simple model, UV unwrap and mapping is not a tough task. </p>
                <h3>Rigging and Skinning</h3>

                    The rigging and skinning procedure turned out to be suprisingly challenging. Little blue was supposed to be a sticky guy so his rigging is obvious and straightfoward, but the skinning process is quite different from normal humanoid skining process. The flaw of model which I mentioned above, that in each joints there are limited buffing polygons for me to manage so the skinning weight of them are harshly distributed:

                    <span className="img-caption">The steep weight change in the right shoulder joint.</span>
                </div>
                <p>Also, during the rigging process which I done before skinning, I placed the shoulder joint too extruded, which resulted in the arms of Little Blue are as if not part of the body.</p>
                <h3>Animation</h3>
                <p>The final animation with rendering can be viewed in the youtube video below:</p>

                </div>
                <p>I tried my best to made each clip of animation as smooth as water, but turned out that this is very, very time costing. Therefore since the project are sized in a tiny version I skipped lot of detail implementations.</p>
